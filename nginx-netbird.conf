# NetBird nginx Configuration Reference
#
# This file is NOT used at runtime. The actual nginx.conf is generated
# by start.sh at each startup.
#
# See: https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/external-reverse-proxy#nginx-combined
#
# Key routing rules for the combined server:
#
# 1. gRPC paths (Signal + Management) -> grpc_pass to netbird-server:80
#    /signalexchange.SignalExchange/*
#    /management.ManagementService/*
#
# 2. WebSocket paths (Relay + WS proxy) -> proxy_pass with Upgrade headers
#    /relay*
#    /ws-proxy/*
#
# 3. HTTP paths (API + OAuth2) -> proxy_pass
#    /api/*
#    /oauth2/*
#    /setup
#
# 4. Dashboard (catch-all) -> static files
#    /*
